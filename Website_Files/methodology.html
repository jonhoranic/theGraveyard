            <p>For the Graveyard project, our research began with the decision to locate and archive
                local graveyard records, and after a wide search, the project team all settled for
                the historic <a href="http://inwestmoreland.com/business/brush-creek-cemetery/"
                    >Brush Creek Cemetery</a>. The cemetery was easily accessible by the team and
                the staff were happy to assist us in our data collection. We settled on a smaller
                section of graves sitting within a fork in the road into the hill portion of the
                cemetery. The decision was made to work with it specifically due to the mix of
                stones and mausoleums. After a full four to five days of data collection, with the
                help of Sheila Rothwell (the current office secretary at Brush Creek Cemetery) the
                team was able to locate the chosen section under the heading of section letter "I"
                and proceeded to detail information. Photographs of the site were taken in
                preparation as the process of data collection continued.</p>

            <p>Any information the team currently possesses has come from stored cemetery files,
                which could contain no instances of, or many instances of the following items: lot
                ownership cards, interment cards, interment orders, individual lot maps, cremation
                records, exhumation/re-interment orders, burial permits, and newspaper clippings of
                related to the occupant(s). Each source document on hand was copied, organized and
                stored for the team to develop a coding markup framework based on the names of
                owners and occupants of individual lots with any relevant information taken from the
                records associated person to person. After creating a suitable framework to begin
                working on, the decision was made to develop the code to match TEI standards, using
                TEI Epidoc as a model. </p>

            <p>The TEI refers to <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">The Text Encoding
                    Initiative</a>, a community of people who work to maintain particular markup for
                the web. Our decision to transform our markup onto Tei was influenced by the idea to
                create a series of files that could last overtime, and that could be tranferred to
                other web developers to sustain and improve our site.</p>

            <p> Next, an ODD file was built with the assistance of UPG Professor Elisa
                Beshero-Bondar. From there, a massive effort to develop project XSLT with
                significant help from in class coding aide, Rebecca Parker. Schemas inside
                Schematron had to be developed to check for possible errors. Once complete, the
                project team was able to better analyze and study all the information gathered in
                one space various research questions formed around what was possible to learn from
                the archived information. Various graphs detailing the gender and age demographics,
                including possible correlations, were built using a mix of HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                and XSLT files to be later displayed while this project webpage UI was being hand
                designed from the ground up. The final challenge for the team was a clickable
                content map made from an overhead satellite image of the section and image mapping
                tools.</p>

            <p>Coding knowledge has been built within the <a
                    href="http://newtfire.org/dh/CDASyll.html">UPG Digital Humanities Course</a> at
                the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg. The ideas were conceived by project team
                members over the Fall 2016 course. The members hope to continue the project in
                coming semesters, and expand the site to contain more sections and occupants of the
                cemetery.</p>

            <p>The project team owes many thanks to the staff of Brush Creek Cemetery for their
                kindness, assistance, and allowance to make this project possible.</p>
