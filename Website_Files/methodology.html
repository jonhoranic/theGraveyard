        <div class="p2">
            <p>Our research began with the decision to locate and archive local graveyard records,
                and after a wide search, the project team all settled for the historic Brush Creek
                Cemetery, which was easily accessible by the team and the staff were happy to assist
                us in our data collection. We settled on a smaller section of graves sitting within
                a fork in the road into the hill portion of the cemetery. The decision was made to
                work with it specifically due to the mix of stones and mausoleums. Over a full
                spending four to five days of data collection, with the help of Sheila Rothwell (the
                current office secretary at Brush Creek Cemetery) the team was able to locate the
                chosen section under the heading of section letter “I” and proceeded to detail
                information. Photographs of the site were taken in preparation as the process of
                data collection continued. Any information the team currently has come from stored
                cemetery files, which could contain no instances of, or many instances of the
                following items: lot ownership cards, interment cards, interment orders, individual
                lot maps, cremation records, exhumation/re-interment orders, burial permits, and
                newspaper clippings of related to the occupant(s). Each source document on hand was
                copied, organized and stored for the team to develop a coding markup framework based
                on the names of owners and occupants of individual lots with any relevant
                information taken from the records associated person to person. After creating a
                suitable framework to begin working on, the decision was made to develop the code to
                match TEI standards, using TEI Epidoc as a model. An ODD file was built with the
                assistance of UPG Professor Elisa Beshero-Bondar, and from there a massive effort to
                develop project XSLT with significant help from in class coding aide, Rebecca
                Parker. Schemas inside Schematron had to be developed to check for possible errors.
                Once complete, the project team was able to better analyze and study all the
                information gathered in one space various research questions formed around what was
                possible to learn from the archived information. Various graphs detailing the gender
                and age demographics, including possible correlations, were built using a mix of
                HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and XSLT files to be later displayed while this project
                webpage UI was being hand designed from the ground up. The final challenge for the
                team was a clickable content map made from an overhead satellite image of the
                section and image mapping tools. Coding knowledge has been built within the UPG
                Digital Humanities Course, and the project team owes many thanks to the staff of
                Brush Creek Cemetery for their kindness, assistance, and allowance to make this
                project possible.</p>
